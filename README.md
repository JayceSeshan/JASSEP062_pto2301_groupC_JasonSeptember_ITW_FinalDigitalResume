Final Digital Resume by Jason September

For my capstone project I built a standard functioning resume from scratch.I made it severely simple to read and very straight forward where as it starts from top to bottom.My resume consist of a header which contains my name and job discription as well as a nav bar to help readers scroll through the resume more easily.My resume start with profile picture of myself and a short introduction as to what I do for a living.After the introduction you will find the information about my education and qualifications.I have list of my skills of code and how confident I am within that specific catagory when it comes to coding.Experience is up next displaying my previous work experiences and what my daily routine and or job title was for that specific job.Below the experiences we have a form you can use in order to contact me by filling in your details.My contact details will be right at the bottom of the screen withba contact number and email address and two buttons linked to my github and the other to my linkedin profile.

How to use ?

Click on any button on the nav bar at the top of the screen to navigate through out the webpage.
