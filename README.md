Final Digital Resume by Jason September

For my capstone project I built a standard functioning resume from scratch.I made it severely simple to read and very straight forward where as it starts from top to bottom.My resume consist of a header which contains my name and job discription as well as a nav bar to help readers scroll through the resume more easily.
